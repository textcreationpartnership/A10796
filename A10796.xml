            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles

They could maintaine themſelues, and therefore ſometimes receiued neither tithes, nor bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolence: our times of earning money muſt needes bee ſpent in turning ouer, and pooring vpon inke and paper, and therefore wee haue neede not to forbeare all, as they might, but to require liberall and certaine maintenance, without which our hearts may breake for iuſt griefe, that in an vnafflicted eſtate, we our ſelues, beeing the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God, muſt be afflicted with diſhonourable ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſlauiſh depending vpon the vncertaine and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable pleaſure of worldly men. If it were laid to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles charge, that they did preach only to gaine wealth by their preaching, and to feede their bellies, then had they no readier way to repell this calumnie, then by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing maintenance where they were ſo ſlandered, as Paul was among the Corinthians. But if the Miniſter vnder the Chriſtian Magiſtrate be ſo traduced, he hath an other way to be releeued, while the Magiſtrate doth make the backe of the ſlanderer to ſmart, or his purſe to pay, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till his falſe tongue be reformed, and iuſtly compelled with his owne ſhame to reclaime the diſgrace of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. And ſo ſtill the caſe is differing. We claime our certaine maintenance in honourable ſort by the Apoſtles doctrine, beeing not tied vnto their examples in this caſe, ſeeing the goodneſſe of God hath made our times better then theirs in Chriſtian Magiſtrates, as he had made their qualifications to exceed ours in their abounding and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie meaſure of ſpirituall graces.</p>

                  <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> did at the firſt offer vnto God of the goods which God had giuen vnto them. What ſhall we thinke of that their fact? was it a worke of ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or of dutie? Of ſupererogation it was not: for if they had not beene bound both to offer, and in ſome ſort alſo to the meaſure and manner of their offering, how could <hi>Cain</hi> haue been miſliked for the leanneſſe or ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his ſacrifice, when he was not bound to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of any? It was therefore a dutie whereunto they were bound, for the acknowledgement of their Lord, by the true payment of their rent and tribute, and therefore all others are in them admoniſhed of this: vz. that there is a reſerued rent, and an impoſed tribute vnto
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16470:11"/>
Almightie God vpon euery part of their worldly eſtate, as God by his bleſſing ſhall cauſe the ſame to be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And although it be not preciſely ſet downe, that the portion which <hi>Abel</hi> did, and <hi>Caine</hi> either did or ſhould haue willingly offered was the tenth, yet it is likely that it was the tenth rather then any other, if we compare their practiſe with other Scriptures, which concerne pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from man to God, as (God willing) ſhall appeare. Manifeſt it is, that God hath a peculiar right to ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall part of euery mans increaſe. And if then the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be, how great, or how little that part is? certenly we muſt anſwer, the tenth: for this is the only part which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer God challenged, as peculiar and certen.</p>
               <p>And as thus in the old Teſtament, ſo alſo in the New we find tythes challenged to be the Lords, though not by the very name of tythes, yet vnder the generall name of the Lords due: as, Matth. 22. 21. <hi>Giue. vnto God that which is Gods.</hi> The queſtion is there, concerning world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, whereof their tribute vnto the Emperour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted.

               <p>But peraduenture ſome bodie will ſay, that though this place cited out of Saint Matt. be of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet it concerneth the ſtate of the Iſraelites vnder the Leuiticall prieſthood: and therefore that I haue all this while onely prooued that tythes were Gods ſpeciall due in the old Teſtament, but not that they are ſo now in the new Teſtament.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that if God had a ſpeciall intereſt in ſome part of our goods in the olde teſtament, he hath the ſame intereſt ſtill: for we doe not any where finde that God
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16470:12"/>
hath reſigned this right. And whereas further the Lord hauing formerly both challenged and receiued vnder the lawe, and before the lawe, not onely apart, but ſpecially and by name a tenth part, it is our dutie ſtill to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and performe for Gods due, not onely a part (we knowe not which) but euen this knowne particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined part, except the Lord had in the new teſtament either wholly diſclaimed this right, or elſe remooued it to a newe rate: which he hath not done, either directly, or indirectly.

We muſt conſider farther the text, which addeth the reaſon of Abrahams refuſall, vz. <hi>Least the King of Sodome ſhould ſay, I haue made Abraham rich.</hi> Abraham depending vpon God, and hauing experience of Gods bountie in ſo wonderfully increaſing him, as that hee maintained in his owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16470:20"/>
whatſoeuer he talketh in boaſt of his God, yet the truth is, hee may thanke his good fortune in conquering the foure Kings, and he may thanke the King of Sodome for ſo bountifully rewarding that peece of ſeruice. To eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew therefore this calumnie, doth Abraham refuſe the wealth of the King of Sodome. Now if Abraham were l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>able to the like imputation from the enuious grudging Heathen, by offering a ſacrifice of their goods vnto his God, as well as by appropriating the ſame vnto his owne ſelfe, then we muſt thinke that Abraham was alſo carefull not to offer any ſacrifice vnto God of the goods of the Heathen. For howſoeuer they might haue ſeemed cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully contented for a time, while their deliuerance was freſh, yet afterwards the memoriall of the benefit recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from Abraham would haue decaied, his goodneſſe would haue beene extenuated, and his ſacrifice blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. For to this effect, in time vnthankfulneſſe might haue taught them to ſpeake. Indeed, Abraham was very liberall to his God, in offering ſo great a ſacrifice, as the tenth part of all the ſpoiles, but hee was francke at other mens charges, for they were our goods which he offered ſo abundantly. When as then, thus might they haue blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed his ſacrifice as well as ſlaundered his eſtate, it is alike requiſite for him to ſhunne calumnie in the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is not vntrue that theſe ſpoiles were now Abrahams owne goods, <hi>iure belli,</hi> by the law of armes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he might conſcionably haue offered of them vnto God, what part he pleaſed, without any iuſt imputation of doing any wrong vnto the Heathen, but ſo he might alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16470:20"/>
the mouthes of the heathen, either iuſtly or vniuſtly to ſpeake euill of his profeſſion: and therefore as he will accept of no wealth for himſelfe, but ſuch as God giueth him freely without being any way beholding to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then for them, as you may ſee in the buriall of Satah, ſo, <note place="margin">Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>If any bodie ſhall ſay, that howſoeuer Abraham might reſigne his owne right vnto the king of Sodome, yet he could not reſigne Gods part, but muſt performe that vnto God in his prieſt Melchiſedech: I anſwer, that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer this coniecture is not ſo agreable to the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the text, yet it fauoureth the cauſe altogether: for if of neceſſitie he muſt offer vnto God his part, then it is graunted that there is a part, and this tenth part (for of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther determined parts we haue neither rule nor practiſe) due vnto God, and to be receiued by his miniſter out of euerie mans increaſe: for if the tythes be due in ſpoiles of warre, which are obtained with ſuch charge of armie, <note place="margin">

               <p>But there is yet in the text another inducement, to mooue vs to thinke that Abraham paid no tythes out of thoſe ſpoyles. For where Abraham in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That Abraham did pay vnto Melchiſedech the tythes of <hi>all,</hi> that is moſt manifeſt, but that he paid tithes out of the ſpoiles that is againſt the tenure of that Scripture: the word <hi>acrothinion,</hi> in Hebr. 7. importeth no ſuch matter.

And therefore whoſoeuer this Melchiſedech was, it is probable that he was the firſt borne in the familie of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham: the Scripture ſaith, that he was without father, without mother, hauing neither beginning of dayes nor ende, which is not ſpoken ſimply and abſolutely, but by a figure; firſt, becauſe the Scripture mentioneth not who were his Parents. Secondly, becauſe he beeing a type of Chriſt, hath that eternitie aſcribed vnto him by reaſon of Chriſt, who as he is man, hath no father, and as he is god hath no mother, and as he is the eternall God hath no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of dayes, &amp;c. yet is it not vnlikely that this Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech was Sem the eldeſt ſonne of Noah, as ſome
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16470:21"/>
learned men doe thinke, for Sem was liuing when Iſaac <note place="margin">Carlet tyth. cap. 2.</note> was 50. yeares old, and therefore almoſt all the dayes of Abraham. As Melchiſedech therefore being by his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to haue the care and charge of Abraham, came to gratulate his victorie, and to praie to God to bleſſe him: ſo Abraham in acknowledgement of the Prieſthood of Melchiſedech, doth pay vnto him his tythes, which were his due in regard of his calling. As for the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the dwelling of Abraham and Melchiſedech, it could not be great, when Abraham dwelt in Hebron, &amp; Melchiſedech in Ieruſalem, as it hath ſince beene called. And Melchiſedechs ſo readie viſiting of Abraham in his returne from ouerthrowing the kings, doth ſhewe that they were not farre a ſunder, ſo that it was poſſible for Melchiſedech to receiue Abrahams tythes from time to time; and ſo the rule is obſerued, that before the Law, the firſt borne both did the dutie, and receiued the due of the prieſthood.</p>
               <p>The third practiſe which the Scripture mentioneth of paying tribute vnto God, is Geneſ. 28. 22. <hi>Of all that thou ſhalt giue me, I will giue the tenth vnto thee.</hi> Though this bee but a promiſe of a practiſe for the time to come, yet I hence prooue manifeſtly, that Iaacob did practiſe paying of tythes. For, firſt, the good Patriarke is not here rapt with a fit of ſhipmens holineſſe, to promiſe that he neuer performed. Secondly, conſidering that he was bleſſed of God in his iourney, and did come againe, and according to his promiſe did build the houſe in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel, he did alſo there pay the tythes of all that <hi>God gaue</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen 35. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>vnto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome thinke, that they haue exception inough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this practiſe of Iacob, becauſe it was (ſay they) meerely voluntarie, and not any thing whereunto hee was abſolutely bound: for he doth bind himſelfe vnto it by a vow, if god bleſſe him and bring him againe in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16470:22"/>
whereas if it had beene a neceſſarie dutie, hee muſt haue performed it without condition, whether God had performed his deſire or not.</p>
               <p>I anſwer that it is true, that Iaacob was bound to pay his tythes vnto God without condition, and though hee had not vowed; but it will not followe, that becauſe he vowed to pay tithes, therefore the thing in it ſelfe is arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie: for, men may vowe neceſſarie and morall duties, as it is moſt euident in this very vow of Iacob, if it be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered as it is ſet downe at large. <hi>If God will bee</hi>

                  <hi>quae debet fieri deo de his quae dei ſunt ſecundum eundem:</hi> that is, A vow is a certen teſtification of a voluntarie promiſe made vnto God of thoſe things which are Gods accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto God. Where the promiſe is called voluntarie, but the thing promiſed muſt be agreeable to the will of God, for elſe in ſtead of worſhipping God by our vows, we onely performe will-worſhip, if we vow any thing vnto God before we know the thing which we promiſe be a thing which God requireth: Hereunto ſerue the words of <hi>Culvin,</hi> when he ſaith of this vow of Iacob, <hi>non quod ſuo arbitrio deum coluerit,</hi> that is, not that he would worſhip God after his owne fancie: where hee further admoniſheth, <hi>ne quid voueant niſi quod per ſe Deo probatur, &amp; illis dedit in manum:</hi> that is, men ought not to vow any thing but that which of it ſelfe is allowed of God, and which he hath giuen into their hands. If we may vow or offer nothing vnto God, but that which God requireth, then it followeth neceſſarily, that tythes were required by God, becauſe they were vowed by Iacob.</p>
               <p>But all this while an aduerſary may thinke, that he may graunt vnto me all that yet I haue ſpoken concerning this vow of Iacob, and yet denie that any concluſion to my purpoſe can be inferred thereupon: for in this vow of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, euen the former part thereof which is neceſſarie, is not yet ſo neceſſarie, but that ſomething in it is arbitrarie and not neceſſarie it ſelfe, but onely in regard of the vow: for where it is ſaid, <hi>this stone ſhall be Gods houſe,</hi> it may ſeeme neceſſarie to haue a ſet place for the ordinarie and ſolemne worſhip of God, but that the place muſt be this very Bethel, this ſeemeth not neceſſarie; for it may ſeeme
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16470:23"/>
to be in the power of Iacob, to build his altar either here or in ſome other place where hee thinke good; ſo that howſoeuer in the generall, it is neceſſarie that there be a place for Gods worſhip, yet in the particular, it might haue beene in another place as well as in this. So in the laſt part of the vow concerning payment of tythes, to maintaine Gods worſhip, it may be graunted neceſſarie in the generall, that there be an allowance, but that this allowance muſt be preciſely and ſimply the very tenth, that may ſeeme ambiguous: for as the one a circumſtance of place, ſo the other a circumſtance of quantitie, may ſeeme to be left to mens diſcretion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true as we ſhewed, cap. 4. that diuers cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are diuers times permitted to the diſcretion of godly men: but in matters ſo ſerious and waightie, as the worſhip of God, and their holy vowes, they are euer moſt warie not to determine any of the leaſt circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces but vpon ſpeciall cauſe, as may appeare in this vow of Iacob.</p>
               <p>One might thinke that for this circumſtance of place, an other place might haue ſerued as well as this, but we ſhall finde, if we duely examine it, that Iacob doth not aſſume this place onely vpon his owne pleaſure, but vpon ſuch waighty reaſons as did tie Iacob to this place before any other. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, In this place God did both reueale Chriſt with his benefits vnto Iacob vnder the figure of that ladder which appeared vnto him in his dreame, and alſo make promiſe vnto him both of a ſafe returne into his countrie, and alſo of the inioying of the whole land of Canaan for a poſſeſſion and inheritance to him and to his ſeede In this place did God promiſe vnto Iacob that his ſeed ſhould multiplie as the duſt of the earth all the world o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and that the propitiator Ieſus Chriſt, who ſhould procure the eternall happines vnto the world, ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16470:24"/>
alſo from the very loynes of Iacob, as is plaine from the beginning of v. 11. vnto the end of the 15. v.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Iacob doth not vow to make this place the houſe of God of his owne head, but God hath firſt made the place to be his houſe, and then Iacob doth but accept of the place which God had choſen: for ſo the text is plaine, <hi>This is no other but euen the houſe of God:</hi> ſo that Iacob hath no more libertie for building vnto God an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar in this place, then Salomon had for building the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Ieruſalem, vz. <hi>in the place which God himſelfe had</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Reg. 8. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>choſen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that whether we conſider the firſt reaſon, namely, that in this place Iacob found ſo much fauour, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo many faire and ſure promiſes at the hands of God: or the ſecond reaſon, vz. that this is Gods houſe already, God himſelfe hauing already choſen it; we ſhall ſee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that this was the onely place for Iacob to build an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar for God in: for firſt no place ſo fit and beneficiall for Iacobs deuotions, as the place which could put him in minde of ſo many large heauenly fauours: and ſecondly a neceſſitie is laide vpon Iacob to make this the houſe of God, for God himſelfe had made it his owne houſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie.</p>
               <p>Thus farre then it is very plaine, that euery whit of this vow of Iacob is a matter neceſſarie, yea the leaſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof hath a moſt due regard to the aforego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will of God, in preciſe and particular determination, vowing no more to God then what God himſelfe already required.</p>
               <p>Then for the laſt part of the vow, which concerneth prouiſion to maintaine Gods worſhip, we muſt alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that it is grounded vpon ſpeciall cauſe, not onely in generall, that it muſt be ſomething, but alſo in particular, that it muſt be this determined ſomething, the <hi>very tenth:</hi> for if the particular place of the altar was not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16470:24"/>
aſſigned without ſpeciall cauſe, then aſſuredly Iacob, ſo godly a man, ſo well inſtructed, ſo deepely affected in his minde with reuerence, as appeareth v. 17. ſo aduiſed and ſerious in the whole carriage, ſo faithfully regarding to flie his owne fantaſies, and to follow carefully the very will of God in the leaſt circumſtance of the reſt of his vow, doth not now in <hi>extremo deficere,</hi> and in the laſt point ſwarue from Gods direction to his owne deuiſe: but as in the former points, ſo alſo in this he hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the knowne will of Almightie God, vowing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the tenth, becauſe he knew this to be the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God would accept of. For, if the eight, ninth, <note place="margin">

Yea further, it is not likely that Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob durſt haue determined any part, if he had not either knowne aforehand, or beene preſently informed that that was the ſhare which God hath reſerued for his owne portion.

                     </gap>.</note> Iacob vowed it ſhould be ſo, but Iacob vowed he would ſo eſteeme it, becauſe it is Gods houſe alreadie: Euen ſo the tenth part becommeth not Gods part, becauſe Iacob doth vow that it ſhall be Gods, but Iacob doth vow that he will faithfully performe the tenth to God, becauſe he knoweth it to be the Lords owne part alreadie. And herein Iacob doth no more (his act of vowing onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) then had bin practiſed by his forefathers, as hath bin ſhewed in the former inſtance of his grandfather A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</p>
               <p>The fourth practiſe concerning payments of tythes, is that of the Iſraelites, from the time of Moſes, vnto the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh, which is the ſpace of ſome 1500. yeares, all which time tythes were paid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Leuites by Gods aſſignation or appointment: who taking the Leuites into his ſpeciall ſeruice in the ſtead of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16470:25"/>
the firſt borne, aſſigned vnto them his ſpeciall reuenues of tythes and offerings for their ſeruice, ſo long as the ſame ſhould endure, as hath beene ſhewed, cap. 4.</p>
               <p>But here now I thinke it ſit, to ſhew ſomething more fully, that howſoeuer the Leuites had the vſe of the tithes while they adminiſtred at the altar, and in the temple, &amp; tabernacle; yet <hi>tythes</hi> were not any ſuch Leuiticall matter, as was to ceaſe when the children of Leui gaue ouer their Prieſthood. Indeede that is the common error, vz. that tythes were meerely Leuiticall, and therefore now ceaſe to be due by the word of God: but I ſhall by the helpe of God, ſhew the contrarie by good reaſon. Thus therefore I argue.</p>
               <p>That which is neither ceremoniall, nor iudiciall, is not meerely Leuiticall: Payment of tythes, is neither cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall, nor iudiciall: therefore payment of tythes is not meere Leuiticall.</p>
               <p>The Propoſition is manifeſtly true; for the whole law of God, beeing either Morall, Iudiciall, or Ceremoniall, it followeth euidently, that what is neither Ceremoniall, nor Iudiciall is Morall, and therefore not Leuiticall: for howſoeuer the moral Law was of force in the time of the Leuiticall Prieſthood, yet the morall Lawe was not Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall: for that is called Leuiticall which began and ended with the Prieſthood of Leui: the Moral lawe was before, and continueth ſtill to the ende of the world: therefore the morall lawe is not Leuiticall; no more are tythes, for they are alſo morall, becauſe they are neither ceremonial, nor Iudiciall. And firſt I will prooue, that they are not ceremoniall.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that cannot be a Leuiticall ceremonie, which is <note place="margin">

Secondly, that this determinate quantitie among the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, was Iudiciall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:16470:28"/>
Concerning the firſt, vz. that a determining of a tenth part can not be morall, I referre it to the thirteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this treatiſe, to come in among other obiections, &amp; there to receiue full anſwer.</p>
               <p>As for the other, vz. that the determining of a tenth part to be paid vnto the Leuites by the Iſraelites was by the Iudiciall, the Schoolemen would prooue thus: The people of Iſrael were diuided into 12. Tribes; the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites were the twelfth part of the people: if they had beene the tenth part of the people, then the tenth part of euery mans increaſe truely paid, doth make vnto the Leuite a ſhare equall with the reſt of his brethren, when he had elſe none inheritance among them: but for ſo much as God foreſaw that many of the people would be ſlacke in payments of what they were inioyned, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God appointed vnto them the tenth, that ſo, though there were ſome ſlackeneſſe and default, yet the Leuite ſhould be ſure of a competent eſtate, and ſuch as ſhould hold proportion with the other Tribes.</p>
               <p>This conceit doth much pleaſe the reſt of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp; is now the beſt plea that the Papiſts haue to cleare their holy Father the Pope from the imputation of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Church-robberie; it is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> only helpe.</p>

The Prieſts before the Lawe had not the tenthes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were the tenth part of the people, but in regard of their Prieſthood, as is ſhewed, chap. 7. no more had the Leuites the tythes in regard of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but in regard of their ſeruice in the tabernacle, as hath beene ſhewed in the fourth Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:16470:28"/>
Secondly, the Leuite is not the tenth, nor the twelfth part of the people, but the thirteenth: for howſoeuer the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Ioſeph are reckoned as one tribe, yet they were two mightie tribes, Ephraim and Manaſſes, the leaſt of them being three times at the leaſt as many as the Leuites: ſo that if the people be reckoned but onely in groſſe by their tribes, yet are the Leuites but the thirteenth part of the people.</p>

The iuſt tenth part of this number, is ſixtie two thouſand, foure hundreth, ſeauentie three: but the whole number of the Leuites is not much more then the third part of this tenth part. And yet there is an other matter to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, which will much leſſen the number of the Leuites, for wheras in the numbring of the reſt of the tribes, none commeth into the number but ſuch as were twentie yeare old, and alſo fit for warre, ver. 2. the Leuites are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred from a moneth old, ver. 62. who are not yet to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute any office in the tabernacle, vntill they be fiue and twenty yeare old, Num. 8. 24. &amp; after the age of fifty, they were to ceaſe and to execute that office no longer, v. 25. Now let a man eſteem by geſſe how many in thoſe three and twenty thouſand Leuites were not onely vnder the age of fiue and twentie, but alſo vnder the age of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, vnder which age none of the other tribes are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16470:29"/>
let him alſo eſteeme how many of that whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Leuites might be aboue fiftie, and I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but that he muſt deduct the one halfe at leaſt, and ſo the number of the Leuites ſhal not be much aboue eleuen thouſand, which doth not greatly exceede the ſixt part of the tenth. So that by this true account, the Leuites are ſo farre from beeing the tenth part, that indeede they prooue to be the threeſcore or ſixtieth part of the people of Iſrael, when they were numbred in the wilderneſſe, a little before their entrance into the land of Canaan, and ſoon after that the Lord had aſſigned the tithes to be the portion of the Leuites.</p>
               <p>Afterward the Leuites are reckoned from thirty yeare olde, and their number is increaſed to 38000. 1. Chr. 23. 3. but the people are alſo increaſed accordingly, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, 1. Chron. 21. 5. to be almoſt ſixteene hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men of warre in Iſrael and Iudah, beſides the men of Beniamin, who are not in the number, v. 6. who in all likelihood could not bee leſſe then two hundreth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, conſidering that 400. yeares paſt in the account, Numb. 26. they were no leſſe then fiue and fortie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and ſix hundreth: and alſo the citie Ieruſalem, and the moſt populous places of the countrie was in the land of Beniamin. So that ſtill it is moſt plaine, that the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and their followers, doe roaue very wide, and come nothing neere the marke, while they make the Leuites to be the tenth part of the people of Iſrael: and ſo their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to prooue that the tythes had beene due to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites by a iudiciall lawe, falleth to the ground, for the foundation thereof is found to be deceitfull.</p>
               <p>Neither onely the ſchoolemen in their acuteneſſe haue thus thought the tythes an equal portion for the Leuites, whome they vnadviſedly reputed to be about the tenth part of the people, but alſo diuerſe others waying the matter in common equitie, and conſidering the Leuites

               <p>But when this alſo ſhall haue beene duely conſidered, which I haue made plaine, vz. that of Leuites fit for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, there was not aboue one Leuite to threeſcore men, of the other tribes, beeing all men of warre, and either beeing or fit to be Maſters of families, it will appeare that the number of Miniſters now a dayes in other countries, proportionable for multitude to the land of Canaan, had not neede be any leſſe then was the number of Leuites: for may not euery threeſcore, yea euery fiftie or fortie houſholds be accounted ordinarily a competent charge for one Miniſter?

bountie, but in bounden dutie, and neceſſarily; for to receiue a parcell of goods bee it the ninth, tenth, or eleuenth, more or leſſe, at a mans hands, by way of chance, beneuolence, or bountie, is no proofe of any preiſthood in the receiuer, but of bountie and liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the beſtower; but the Apoſtle doth prooue that Melchiſedech was preiſt euen by this argument, <hi>becauſe hee did receiue tythes of Abraham,</hi> which alſo the actiue word vſed, ver. 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, doth imply: for it is not ſaid, that <hi>Abrahamus decimauit ſeipſum,</hi> but <hi>Melchiſedech de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimauit Abrahamum,</hi> that is, tooke his owne part, not receaued a voluntarie gift. And therefore Abraham was bound to pay his tythes to Melchiſedech: and tythes are due to the Prieſthood whereſoeuer that bee either in Melchiſech or in Leui, as hath beene ſhewed in chap. 3. and 4.</p>
               <p>When the Apoſtle had demonſtrated the Prieſthood of Melchiſedech, he beginneth then verſ. 4. to compare the ſame with the Prieſthood of the Leuites; ſo as by Melchiſedech he vnderſtandeth Chriſt, and ſaith of him, ver. 8. that he receiueth tythes: <hi>here men that die, receiue tythes; but there he receiueth them, of whom it is written, that he liueth.</hi> Some would here reſtraine theſe words to Melchiſedech the type, as if <hi>he of whome it is written, that hee liueth,</hi> muſt bee referred to Melchiſedech, and not to Chriſt: but wee muſt knowe what the text ſpeaketh moſt plainely, that theſe things are ſpoken of Chriſt by the name of Melchiſedech: for ſo are the words, ver. 13. 14. <hi>He of whome theſe things are ſpoken pertaineth to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tribe, whereof no man ſerued at the altar: for it is euident, that</hi> OVR LORD <hi>ſprung out of Iudah.</hi> So then, <hi>He,</hi> that is, <hi>our Lord,</hi> that is, Chriſt, receiueth tythes, and tythes belong to the Prieſthood of Chriſt by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the newe Teſtament. For as vnder the Lawe it was not ſo much the Leuites, as gods in the Leuites, they

Now this was added, leaſt the latter lawe ſhould ſeeme to haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated (as the manner is) any thing from the former: for elſe it might be expected, that the right which Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech enioyed of old, is now repealed, becauſe God hath giuen an other lawe by Moſes, whereby he tranſlated that right vnto the Leuites.

And hereby is diſcouered the error of thoſe, who thinke that before there were diſtinction of pariſhes, which, (ſay they, and therein alſo they are deceiued, was <note place="margin">Ann.

                  </gap>t pay his tythes to whom himſelfe thought good.</p>
               <p>But doe they thinke indeed that before the counſell of Lateran, men might pay their tythes to whom they liſted? then I aske of them, by what law were they bound to ſuch payments? by a humane conſtitution? nothing leſſe: for howſoeuer the ſimplier hearted world heretofore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted all ſtatutes in ſhorter lines and fewer words then now they doe, yet find we no lawes of ſo great antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as that they had not then learned to include ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie circumſtances of paiments, as the partie to whom the payment be made. If it be then anſwered, that not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny humane lawes, but meere conſcience, did mooue men to pay tythes in thoſe former times, and therefore did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man beſtow his tythes then vpon that or thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to whom in conſcience he thought them moſt due, then the queſtion is yeelded, vz. that tythes are due by the law of God without any humane decree; for if the conſcience be tied, and not by any law of man, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenly there is the direct law of God.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, that euer ſince the Church had a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrate, and that things could be throughly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, there haue beene humane lawes to enforce the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tythes, which were formerly due by the law of God: for tythes beeing long acknowledged, and paid in the Church, before there were any humane lawes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning payments of tythes which were formerly due by the law of God, it followeth plainely, that they were held due in the Primitiue Church by the law of God: and as for that which is ſurmiſed of the choiſe of their teacher, vnto whom they would pay, it is a very dreame: for as we haue ſhewed, the tythes before diſtinction of pariſhes
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16470:35"/>
were to be brought into the common treaſurie, and diſtribution to be made thereof by the conſent of the Biſhop.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but ſome precedents may be ſhewen of men paying their tythes, ſome to one, ſome to an other, as each man beſt fancied: but then it was either by ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all licence, obtained for that purpoſe, or done by ſuch men, as either for their greatneſſe could not bee ruled, or for their meaneſſe, or looſeneſſe of the times were not regarded, and then <hi>factum eſt, ſed non oportuit,</hi> that is, that was done, which ought to haue beene vndone: it beeing contrarie both to the godly cuſtome of the Primitiue times, and the wholeſome laws of ſucceeding Churches, according to the words of that Palentine Councel, <hi>Anno</hi> 1322. <hi>Parochiarum diuiſio à ſanctis patribus inſtituta certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem</hi>

               <p>At laſt, when King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight became a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the faith (in another meaning then the Pope had, when he firſt gaue him that title) that is, In baniſhing the Idolatrie and tyrannic of Antichriſt, which is the Pope, whom hee happily auoided out of this bleſſed Iſland: King <hi>Henrie</hi> (I ſay) finding the ſtollen goods, vz. the tythes of the Church in the cells and cloiſters of Munks, Nunnes, and Friars, like the pretious gold and goodly garment in the tent of Achan, did not either conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reſtore the good to the owner thereof, or religiouſly dedicate it, as a halowed thing vnto the Lord, but ſwai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the errour of the time, became himſelfe receiuer of the Friars theeuerie, and ſhared the ſame among his fauourites, for loue or for mony, as himſelfe thought good; and ſtill the patrimonie of the Lord, is detained in the vniuſt hands of thoſe, who can haue no true inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt therein.

to be no vſurpers. But bethinke thy ſelfe, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou art, who eateſt the milke, and weareſt the wooll of the ſheepe, hauing neither abilitie, nor calling to feed the flocke; bethinke thy ſelfe (I ſay) that if thy fathers, either bought for mony, or receiued as a gift, the goods of the Church, and the portion of the Lord, from thoſe who had no authoritie, either to giue, or to ſell them, the gift or ſale can not be good in law before the exact and feareful barre of the iudgement ſeate of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, who is Lord of Lords, King of Kings, and Iudge of Iudges, and a partie in the caſe.

               <p>In that King Henrie did thus diſpoſe the tythes which he found in the Abbyes, he did more then he had warrant for.

               <p>I would that men, who ſo eagerly preſſe vpon vs, and maintaine againſt vs, the cuſtomes of theſe times, would duely conſider this, and not dare ſo to robbe God, and oppreſſe his Miniſters, as vſually they doe, beeing ſo farre from adding a fifth part to the price they giue, as that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes they doe not performe the fift part of the tythe for the whole tythe.

               <p>And yet it is thought that herein is offered no wrong, becauſe they can plead <hi>Custome.</hi> Indeede here we ſee the ſaying true, <hi>Conſuetudo peccandi tollit ſenſum peccati,</hi> that is, men haue gotten ſuch a cuſtome of robbing the poore Church, as that they thinke it now to be no ſinne: the antiquitie of an euill cuſtome ſhould not beare it out with authoritie, but make it to appeare the more loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and call for the more ſpeedie reformation. It is and hath beene an old cuſtome, for men to robbe vpon the high waies, to cooſen in ſhoppes, and to forſweare themſelues before Iudges; but ſeeing theſe cuſtomes are as wicked as they are old, their gray haires cannot cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite them; but as there are good lawes, and faithfull care to aboliſh thoſe, ſo there ſhould be alſo meanes to reforme thoſe, which as armed theeues doe robbe the Miniſterie, and enthrall the ſoules of thoſe which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe them vnto condemnation, if repentance preuent not.</p>
               <p>Can any man denie that any euill <hi>Cuſtome</hi> ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed? and what goodneſſe in the world can be, yea what wickedneſſe is not in cuſtomes, wherein there is no conformitie with the word of God, nor any one inch of conſcionable equitie? The word of God will haue the tythe, that is compounded for, to be redeemed with more then the true value, equitie would allowe as much price as the thing priced is worth, theſe cuſtomes doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes allow nothing, and oftentimes as good as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: the word of God, and equitie would haue men to deale as they would be dealt with: men would be loath to take ſometimes a crowne, and ſometimes foure crownes for that for which they will ſcarcely allow the Lords Miniſter foure pence: is this equitie, or can any

cuſtome make this conſcionable?</p>
               <p>The plea is, that when any cuſtome firſt beganne, the things ſo compounded for, were eſtimated to be worth no more then is now performed by cuſtome: but what is this to auouch the equitie of the cuſtome? will any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die now afford the Miniſter for his groat, yea for his ſhilling, ſo much of any thing neceſſarie for food, lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, or cloathing, as at the beginning<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

was knowen no ſuch diuerſitie of tything, much loſſe is it allowed by any of them as reaſonable, as may appeare by their writings at large, a taſt whereof is giuen in the ninth chapter, in thoſe few fragments there briefely, but yet faithfully, rehearſed.</p>
               <p>In proceſſe of time as is ſeene in the Decretalls, the indulgence and conniuence of the Church, for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incouraging of men in ſome profeſſions and courſes (conſidering either the caſualties whereunto ſuch trades are ſubiect, or the greatneſſe of the charge wherewith they muſt be followed) hath permitted vnto them a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of their expenſes, requiring tythes onely of that portion of increaſe, which doth remaine as a cleare gaine or aduantage. Where we haue aduiſedly to conſider both what parties may take benefit by this toleration, and alſo what muſt be accounted cleare gaines, and what may beare the name of expenſes, leaſt either ſome without any cauſe, or others beyond the iuſtneſſe of their cauſe, be bould to plead (without contradiction) either exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all, or mittigation in part.</p>
               <p>Of ſuch parties as by any colour of equitie may craue diduction of expenſes, there are three ſorts, the firſt is the husbandman in ſome cauſes; as for example, if a ground which hath beene formerly ſo barren that it was vtterly vnprofitable nor could be made ſoyſonable without great expence, is at laſt, with long and large labour and coſt of the occupier, made good and fruitfull; here it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that a man ſhould be allowed all his charges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he paie any tythe, becauſe that vntill a man hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued all hee hath laid out, he ſeemeth to be rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed then increaſed, but tythes are due of increaſe, therefore they ſeeme not due in theſe caſes.</p>
               <p>Some colour of reaſon this hath, and yet no ſuch abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute force as is without ſtrong reſiſtance; for firſt, that is not a certen rule that tythes are not due, but where the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16470:51"/>
ſtocke is increaſed; for let a man buy a thouſand cattell, all bigge with young, and nine hundred of them not only faile to bring forth, but alſo perriſh vtterly in a litle ſpace, yet is the tythes paid of the increaſe of the reſidue: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, though the ground tilled yeeld not the charge of the ſeede and husbandrie beſtowed vpon it, yet is the tenth caſt out as it is, better or worſe without regard of expenſes. Secondly, in the caſe of improouing grounds, though the charge be great, yet is it not ſo neceſſarily to be allowed before the tythes be paid, for it is much in the nature of a purchaſe to the owner: if a man hath made a purchaſe hee is not to ſay, I will pay no tythes out of ground purchaſed vntill I haue receiued from it ſo much profit as it coſt mee, becauſe that vntill then I am not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed but diminiſhed, euen ſo in this caſe, the charge of improouement hath raiſed the eſtate of the improo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, in that his yearly reuenues are increaſed, and therfore why ſhould not tythes bee due out of ſuch an improue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as out of a purchaſe?</p>
               <p>Indeed in regard of benefiting the common wealth, there is a great difference betweene a purchaſe and an improouement, becauſe that in a purchaſe a propertie onely is altered, but the common wealth not enriched, but in ſuch an improouement the very ſoile is amended and ſo the common wealth is aduantaged, and the church alſo (whoſe eſtate of benefit is to riſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For, if theſe men plead their reaſons, there are anſwers for them in all readines: as, If they ſay, wee are at great charge, and vnder many dangers, what we now gaine, we may looſe againe vpon the next aduenture: The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, that God is the God of the ſea and land, ſo that what gaine ſoeuer is lawfully compaſſed, either by ſea or land, that commeth by the good and free bleſſing of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, and therefore oweth vnto god that tribute which himſelfe impoſeth, and that is his tithe: euen as the tribute of impoſt is paid to the King abſolutely, without reſpect of the merchants charges or dangers.

               <p>A third ſort of people allowed diduction of expences, are ſuch as are vſually called tradeſmen, whoſe condition
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16470:52"/>
is not much vnlike the merchants, for theſe doe buy and ſell commodities, ſometimes in the ſame place or market, ſometimes conuaying them from one place to an other, whether neerer hand or further off, yet ſo as they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much in danger of ſtormes and ſpoylers, as the merchants are: Theſe men as their charge and adventure falleth out to, after the like manner with the merchants, ſo they are allowed their expences proportionably.</p>
               <p>But before I come to define the charge diducible, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but take notice of two ſorts of people, who though they be not either in their charge of their trade, or vſuall loſſes to compare with either the merchant, tradeſman, or husbandman, yet doe they reape a certaine and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent gaine, and yet for tythes either they pay none at all, or they are allowed to haue their expences diducted: theſe are either handicraft men, or vſurers.</p>
               <p>Handicraft men, if they be not vnthriftie, doe with a little ſtocke, ſmall charge, and no hazzard comparable to the merchant, or tradeſman, or husbandman, make ſo good earnings vſually as both to maintaine them and theirs in comelineſſe, and alſo to increaſe their ſtockes, and oftentimes to purchaſe faire eſtates: therefore as they doe came money by the bleſſing of God in ſome large quantitie and much certaintie, with ſmall ſtocke and no great charge, ſo they not onely owe the tenth to God, (who enableth their ioynts, and directeth their fingers to worke, and alſo occaſioneth profitable vtterance to their ware or imployments) but alſo by that time the caſe hath been well examined, they wil be ſound to haue no more, if not leſſe cauſe to require diduction of expences then the verie husbandman, and yet vnto theſe artificers alſo hath the Church in her indulgence allowed their charges to be abated before they tythe.</p>
               <p>Vſurers alſo are men that make a certen gaine and not ſmall, whoſe charge is oftentimes the leaſt of all other

(let no bodie miſtake me, for I ſpeak not of all vſurers or lenders of money but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſuch) He cannot denie but that his gaine is certaine, he cannot pleade that the charge of his trade is great, for the which his expences ſhould be diducted, what can be then alleadge why hee ſhould not pay his tenthes of ſo cleare and ſo eaſie ſo ſure and great gaines?</p>
               <p>It will peraduenture be alleadged that Preachers doe condemne vſurie for vnlawfull, and by that meanes doe exclude themſelues from receiuing tythes of the hire of money: for what is gained vnlawfully may not be offered vnto that God, who will not receiue either <hi>the price of a</hi>

If thou findeſt in thy conſcience that thou takeſt no courſe of gaining but that which God alloweth, then pay thy tythes as his due tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto God, whoſe prouidence hath bleſſed thee: or if thou findeſt that thy practiſe is ſuch, as that thou dareſt not offer the tenth of thy gaine thereof vnto God, then repent in time, and take ſome ſuch courſe of life, as may bring thee ſuch gaine as thou maiſt enioy with a good and quiet conſcience.</p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning ſuch parties as may by any colour craue, and to whom is allowed diduction of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences; we come now to define what we cal theſe expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>What is to be allowed for expences and what to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted cleere games ſeemeth hard to determine becauſe no writer that we can meete withall hath in this point entered into ſo particular termes as were to be wiſhed, yet if the cauſe be duely conſidered in theſe foure cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, 1. conſcionable equitie or reaſon. 2. the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture that may be made vpon the writings of learned men. 3. the aged monuments of former practiſes. 4. the exchequer valuation of benefices in Citties and great townes: I truſt, the iudicious will be ſatisfied.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, a Miniſter dwelling among men whoſe trades <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> doe maintaine them in comelineſſe and plentie, yet not increaſing their eſtate yearely, a miniſter I ſay dwelling among ſuch a people ſhall haue nothing at all due by this diduction of expences, but while his people doe eate the fatte and drinke the ſweete, he may well faſt and pray, for more then they in curteſie ſhall pleaſe (ah, ah) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe vpon him, he may not challenge, if this rule were good. But will any indifferent iudgement allow this for reaſonable? if men did thinke that there ought to be any proportion betweene them and their miniſters in expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then they would remember, that the Miniſter is to liue with them if they haue whereon to liue, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their proportion, richer with thoſe which are richer, poorer with thoſe whith are poorer, and that this meanes of life is due vnto him by conſcience which is to

Why payeth a man tythes but in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment that what hee gaineth is by the bleſſing of the Lord? if then that which thou earneſt toward the maintenance of thy charge and familie be thine owne earning, proceeding either meerely or principally from thine owne endeauour and prouidence, and that onely the ouerplus, which thou canſts ſpare aboue thy neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full expence, proceedeth from the bleſſing of God, then indeede thou art to pay tythes onely of that ſurpluſage or remainder, and not of that wherewith thou doeſt feed and cloath thy houſhold. But if all be of God, why o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt thou not tythes of all thine increaſe, whether it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe toward purchaſing, or towards houſekeeping? howſoeuer it increaſeth it is by Gods bleſſing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore oweth vnto God his tribute.

               <p>Where are thoſe tythes now? were they due onely in time of Poperie? are the Miniſters of the Goſpel debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from them? is this the reward of diſcouering pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and reuealing the truth, that we muſt looſe our tythes for our labours?

                  <p n="1">1. There is in the newe teſtament Commandement to this effect, Gal. 6. 6. <hi>Let him that is taught in the word, make him that hath taught him partaker of his goods:</hi> though there be in theſe words no expreſſe mention of a tenth part, yet there is mention and iniunction of a part, which ought to be performed vnto the Miniſter or Teacher, out of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie mans goods. What part is that? if Scripture may be expounded by Scripture, then that part is the tenth part; for that and no other doth the Scripture aſſigne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminatiuely vnto the Miniſters of God for their ſeruice, as hath beene alreadie ſhewed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What if there were no Commandement for tythes in the newe Teſtament? yet the conſtant practiſe of the Church from time to time neuer ceaſing (except when perfecution put all things out of frame) is a ſufficient rule vnto vs, and of neceſſicie to be obſerued, as in the caſe of the Sabbath, not onely obſerued once in euerie week, but alſo changed from one day vnto an other, this is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in all the newe Teſtament, and yet are we bound vnto this obſeruation, becauſe of the conſtant practiſe of the Church, which is vnto vs a neceſſarie preſident to be imitated.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What hath beene once commanded in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, doth remaine a law for euer, except it hath ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that they bee paid faithfully and gladly vnto him, therefore muſt men either ſhewe that God hath abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this his decree, and relinquiſhed this challenge, or elſe hold themſelues ſtill bound in conſcience to obey God in that commaundement, and to performe vnto him that which he doth challenge.</p>

                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:16470:57"/>
If any bodie will now ſay, that tythes were an appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of the tabernacle and temple, belonging onely ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto as a ceremonie thereof; I haue alreadie prooued the contrarie, cap. 6. and if I had not prooued it, yet were not a mans conſcience euer the more diſcharged; for in this caſe, the tyth-payer is to be put vnto his proofe, it is enough for the receiuer to ſhewe that they were once made his: this holdeth ſtrong vntill the tyth-payer can ſhewe, either that the graunt was made but for a limited time, or elſe that ſince the making, that graunt hath been by ſome act diſanulled: As for example; If it be once e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted that the tenth part of euerie mans liuing bee paid vnto the King, the ſubiect is bound accordingly to make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is payment, except he can expreſſely ſhew that that act hath beene either by ſome other later act repealed, or by ſome inſerted prouiſo expired and auoided. The King ſufficiently prooueth his due, when hee citeth the act or ſtatute: the ſubiect therefore is bound to his obedience, vntill he ſhew a ſufficient diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p>But thou thinkeſt that thou haſt a ſufficient diſcharge, becauſe thou cauſt ſay, the tythes haue ceaſed with the ſacrifices and ceremonies; <hi>alaſſe, alaſſe, ſegging is no good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oping,</hi> thou muſt ſhewe and prooue it: Is it enough to ſay to the King, your tenth and taske is out, and to be paid no longer, becauſe wee haue done paying the laſt graunted ſubſidie? No, no, except that thou canſt prooue that the taskes or tenths were to continue no longer then thoſe ſubſidies ſhould be in paying: So it is not enough for thee to ſay, the tythes haue ceaſed with the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and ſacrifices, except thou canſt prooue by ſome Scripture, that either tythes were ceremonies or ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or that they were to be paid but onely ſo long as the ceremonies and ſacrifices laſted; if thou canſt prooue this, then keepe thy tythes, we will not aske them; we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:16470:57"/>
The precept concerning the Sabaoth day once giuen, was to continue an eternall commandement, neuer to be neglected, becauſe God neuer repealed it. Changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was, but by the ſpirit of god, vpon iuſt and waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie cauſe; ſo tythes once inioyned by God, are ſtill due till God remit them.</p>
                  <p>If a man ſhall ſay, that though it cannot be ſhewed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely with pregnant proofe from the Scripture, when and vpon what cauſe tythes haue beene repealed, yet it may be that there is ſome gueſſe, and peraduenture God may haue repealed tythes vpon ſome ſufficient cauſe, let him remember himſelfe that a man muſt liue by faith, and not by peraduentures: Faith dareth not depart from the reuealed will of God, vpon hope that peraduenture God hath otherwiſe determined, ſeeing that the reuealed will of God which is the Scripture, muſt bee our direction.</p>
                  <p>Therefore though paiment of tythes were not enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the newe Teſtament, yet it ought ſtill to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, becauſe that what the olde Teſtament hath ſo plentifully required in this behalfe, the ſame is not reuoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in any Scripture, either of olde or newe Teſtament. The continuance of a law needeth not a repetition or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond mention: indeede no law is abrogated except it be mentioned, but a lawe once made (without any limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of time) is continued ſtill, in that it is not at all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>

Therefore though the Leuites had no other portion but the inheritance of their publique Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie; yet the Preachers of the Goſpel may be owners of priuate lands and riches, becauſe that the wifes and

But take a tradeſman or handicraft, which with leſſe charge and toile euery way earneth by his owne and his ſeruants la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour fiftie pounds in the yeare, and this man thinketh himſelfe very bountifull, if there come out of his purſe tenne ſhillings to the Miniſters maintenance that yeare, wherein he hath earned fiftie pounds; now here is but the hundreth part paid where the tenth is due, ſuppoſe <note place="margin">

So that Miniſters in townes and citties (whoſe labours are the greateſt in regard both of the multitude of their people, and alſo of their knowledge and iudiciouſneſſe, requiring the more ſtudie and paines at their Miniſters hands to giue them ſatisfaction) haue leſſer and vncertainer reuenues, becauſe that the Cittizen doth hold no proportion in tithing with the countriman.</p>
                  <p>But come we yet ſomething nearer to conſider the Cittizen (in that which concerneth this point, and the matter obiected) without comparing him with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triman, and ſo waigh aduiſedly whether it be iuſtly orno that the Cittizen will giue no greater allowance to his Miniſter, ſeeing he vſually alledgeth that hee doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme in this dutie according to his abilitie? And here once againe good Reader be patient and charitable. I doe not aime at the rebuke of any one particular, but labour to effect that all men may be brought to acknowledge (as it doth concerne them) how they confute themſelues with their owne practiſe, I knowing I ſpeake an vndeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able truth (I thanke God) I am reſolute, then when thou findeſt euidently that what I ſpeake thou canſt not denie, be not of the mind of the Iewes, who were enraged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt when they could not contradict him: but

                  <p>It is the common cuſtome of citizens and inhabitants of great corporations, to celebrate chriſtinings, church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings, mariages, burialls, and ſuch other ſolemnities, with verie large expence, and yet neuer to complaine, nor thinke themſelues grieued. Though one man vpon one meale, or vpon a verie banquet doth lay out either fiue, tenne, or twentie powndes, or yet more, according as hee feeleth himſelfe able or diſpoſed, yet euerie pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie hereof is cheerefully diſpended, but if in regard of the miniſters worke vpon thoſe occaſions either ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily imployed, or extrrordinarily toyled, either lawe or curteſie doth admoniſh them to performe an oblation to the Lord, and to reward his miniſter, then (behold the inclination I will not ſay of all men, God forbid: but of moſt men, and that is enough.) Some with a ſmooth face and ſweet words, will giue him an ouerly kind of thanks, and it may be place him at a ſpare ende of one of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond tables, but as for any other conſideration, either it is none at all, or elſe the offering of a grudging heart, and a withered hand, which is verie miſerable that when they caſt the bils of their lauiſh oſtentation, the miniſters ſhare is ſure one of the leaſt of many Items.</p>
                  <p>Againe, when men ſpeake of any of theſe their great triumphes, they will cheerfully looke vp without diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and ſay, It was but fiue pounds, it was but ten powndes, it was but twentie powndes, &amp;c. It comes but once a yeare, I hope to recouer it by the grace of God. Thus diminutiuely and hopefully men mention any great charge, ſuitable to their owne humors. But if they ſpeak of that ſmall allowance which they make to the Miniſter, then they are euen readie to groane out their words, and they ſound out euerie ſyllable at the full length, with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie

                  <p>I will ſpare to name either men or places, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſuch a caſe as is generall, and can not but be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by any heart that hath in it any religious compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>In diuers very great Corporations, there are entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſome two, in ſome (it may be) three or foure mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters all Preachers, whereof the meaneſt are competently qualified with giftes of knowledge, vtterance and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, very behoofefull to the edification of the Church of God; others of them commonly very choiſe men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and famous, rarely furniſhed. And as theſe men haue their ſeuerall meaſures of ſpirituall endowments, ſo
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:16470:70"/>
they haue diuerſly their ſeuerall exhibitions. Yet ſo as that which is vſually the ſtipend of the beſt, is with the leaſt, if not too little for the meaneſt: and the allowance which commonly is afforded to thoſe who are entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the inferiour or ſecondarie miniſtration (as men vnaduiſedly eſteeme it) is meerely diſhonourable for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Preacher of indifferent partes, or for any man at all who is worthily admitted into ſacred orders, ſpecially while men liue (bleſſed be God) in a plentifull and good land, and are rich and in peace, vnder a Chriſtian gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that I may further cleare what I haue auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: Let vs conſider particularly what theſe ſtipends are which I ſo extenuate.</p>
                  <p>Fourtie markes or thirtie pounds a yeare, are the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſtipends of ſuch Miniſters, as in ſuch places as I mentioned, are accounted the inferiour.

And doe men accounte this to be ſo honourable and ſufficient a reuenue?</p>
                  <p>If men duely conſider the deareneſſe of liuing in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, and great Townes (by reaſon that there, all things muſt be bought with the pennie (as they ſay) and that vnto ſuch eminent men in ſuch places, there is great reſorte and continuall concourſe of acquaintance) they ſhall readily find, that by ſuch time as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:16470:70"/>
Indeed fiftie or threeſcore pounds doth make a loud ſound in a mans care: and yet it is but the maintenance of a meane man in Townes and Citties as this world requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: for doth not the handicraftman who paneth the ſtreet, planchereth the houſe, or ſhapeth the garment, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying but a man and a boy vnder him, if they may be continually ſet on worke (as good workemen neede not loyter much) earne in the yeare as faire a ſtipend, as the greateſt vſually allowed vnto the beſt Preachers who are maintained by their Churches curteſie? It is caſie to caſt, what foure ſhillings a day is in the end of the weeke, and what foure and twentie ſhillings a weeke is, in the end of the yeare: and yet this is but the earning of a handicraft man, as I haue mentioned, and we find by experience, when we haue occaſion to vſe them: which I no way ſpeake, as grudging at the wages, for which the true la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer doth take paines, and earne it decrely with the ſweat of his browes, but therefore doe I inſtance in theſe mens earnings, becauſe they be ſo paralell to thoſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſtipends which are aſſigned as competent for the worthieſt Preachers: that men may ſee how they value the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Surely, hee hath but a meane conceit of the calling of the Miniſterie, who thinketh that a Preacher (though of the beſt deſert) is competently and ſufficiently prouided for, when his maintenance is but comparable to ſuch handie earnings as I haue named. Is this the competent maintenance? is this that double honour, 1. Tim. 5. 17? And yet this is all, that is any where to be heard of, as an ordinarie allowance, but this is not either honourable or competent, as I haue made manifeſt. And therefore, if we be denied our tythes, we may heare men talke of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent maintenance, but we know not where to ſeeke it, with any hope to find it: ſo meanely doe men eſteem our labours.</p>
